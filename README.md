# PIR Passive Infrared Motion Sensor

#### Project Overview

The PIR (Passive Infrared) Motion Sensor project demonstrates how to use an Arduino Nano to interface with a PIR motion sensor. PIR sensors detect motion by sensing changes in infrared radiation emitted by nearby objects. In this project, the sensor detects motion and sends a signal to the Arduino Nano, which then processes the input and triggers an action, such as turning on a light or sounding an alarm.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Nano**
2. **PIR Motion Sensor**
3. **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect PIR Motion Sensor to Arduino Nano:**
   - Connect the signal (OUT) pin of the PIR motion sensor to digital pin 2 on the Arduino Nano.
   - Ensure proper power (VCC) and ground (GND) connections for the PIR motion sensor.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire the PIR motion sensor to the Arduino Nano as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Power Supply:**
   - Ensure the power supply connected to the PIR motion sensor is appropriate for its voltage requirements.

3. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and paste the provided code.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

4. **Testing:**
   - Once the code is uploaded, open the serial monitor.
   - The serial monitor will display "Motion Detected!" when motion is detected by the sensor, and "No Motion Detected" when there is no motion.

#### Applications

- **Security Systems:** Use in security systems to detect motion and trigger alarms or notifications.
- **Automatic Lighting:** Control lighting systems to turn on/off automatically based on detected motion.
- **Energy Saving:** Implement energy-saving measures by activating devices only when motion is detected.

#### Notes

- Adjust the delay in the code to customize the sensor's response time and reduce false triggers.
- Experiment with different sensitivity settings on the PIR motion sensor to optimize performance for specific applications.
- Ensure the sensor is positioned correctly to cover the desired area for motion detection.
